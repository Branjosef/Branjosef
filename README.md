Why hello there!

This is my personal github account I use to develop/maintain cool applications I actually use every day! Everything from a multimedia streaming service, to video games and productivity apps - there's even an interactive 3D application (think Google Earth but in space) to zoom in and check out all the nearfield objects orbiting our Earth. Satellites, debris, junk - if its there, I have the data point and you can visually interact with it. 

The repos are private with collaboration dependent on project.
